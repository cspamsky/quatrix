# Project Brief: Quatrix CS2 Manager

## Overview

A modern, real-time web-based dashboard for managing Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) servers. The application provides a visual interface for server administrators to monitor performance, execute commands via console, manage maps, and oversee player activities.

## Core Requirements

1.  **Dashboard/Live Statistics**: Real-time monitoring of CPU, RAM, and network usage.
2.  **Server Console**: A live terminal to send RCON commands and view server logs.
3.  **Map Management**: Interface to view and change current server maps.
4.  **Player List**: Live view of connected players with management capabilities (kick/ban).
5.  **Plugins/Settings**: Management interface for server plugins and configuration files.
6.  **Secure Authentication**: Multi-user support with protected routes and server ownership.

## Goals

- Provide a premium, high-performance UI (based on the provided template).
- Ensure low-latency communication between the dashboard and the CS2 server.
- Simplify server management tasks that are traditionally handled via CLI or complex config files.
- Maintain a secure, multi-user environment where administrators only see and manage their own resources.
